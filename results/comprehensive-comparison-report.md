# Smart Router vs ElizaOS Baseline: Comprehensive Comparison

## Methodology

Comparison between ElizaOS-style baseline and smart routing using local Ollama models. This evaluation simulates real-world usage patterns with comprehensive test coverage including basic functionality, stress testing, and realistic scenarios.

### Limitations
- Local models may have higher failure rates than production paid models
- Baseline costs are estimated post-hoc (ElizaOS doesn't track costs natively)
- Performance characteristics may differ from production environments with paid models
- Network latency and model loading times may skew results
- Limited model variety compared to production deployments

### Assumptions
- Circuit breaking in baseline provides realistic failure handling patterns
- Cost estimation using equivalent paid model pricing is representative
- Local model performance patterns are indicative of production behavior
- Provider fallback mechanisms work as expected in both systems
- Test scenarios represent realistic usage patterns
